- Madam spoke to us about our true goals in life—why we study, what we truly seek, and what makes life meaningful.
- She emphasized that our first priority should be understanding each other—only then can we truly connect and empathize with others.
- Our second priority should be our relationships—with family, friends, and those around us. Without strong relationships, happiness is incomplete.
- Our third priority should be physical facilities—like money, cars, and houses. These are important, but they should never come before human connection.
